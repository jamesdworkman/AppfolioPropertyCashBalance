# AppfolioPropertyCashBalance
Creates a list of all HOAs with over $250k available cash as a check for FDIC risk
If you manage a lot of HOAs it's important by law that you ensure their cash is FDIC insured. Checking this frequently can be very time consuming 
This script will create a list of all your HOAs, then pull the trial balance for each and add up the cash and subtract the accounts payable balance. 
It will then filter by any over $250k and then email that list to anyone you need to notify, usually yourself and the person in charge of moving funds and creating sweep accounts
You will need to add your Auth credentials, the GL accounts you want to add, and the emails and email signature information
